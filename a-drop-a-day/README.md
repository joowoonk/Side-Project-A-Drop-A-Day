       Why I built this website:
        </a>&nbsp;</h1>
      <p>
    &nbsp;
               As you know there are tasks to finish in a limited amount of time and
        also, we'd agree that time is gold. Most people would also agree that
        the more we stay focused on one thing; we finish stronger and faster.
        However, it's also true that we tend to procrastinate even if we have
        tasks in front of us. Recently, I've been using a technique called&nbsp;
        <a

          the Pomodoro Technique
        </a>
        &nbsp;whenever I need to focus. Although this method has been immensely
        helpful for me to stay focused and stay away from procrastinating, I
        haven't found a website where I can break down on things I was working
        on.
      </p>
      <p>
       For an example, let's say I have some tasks to do on different things.
        Such as:
        <ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Continue writing an essay for my Philosophy of Science class</li>
          <li>
            Solving algorithm problems on Leetcode, two easy problems and one
            medium level problem
          </li>
          <li>
            Read <span style={{ fontStyle: "italic" }}>the Republic</span> by
            Plato
          </li>
        </ul>
  As the to-do list shows above, I implemented a feature where I can set
        how much time I will spend a day for each task. So, the list would look
        like this.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Continue writing an essay for my Philosophy of Science class -->&nbsp;
            <span style={{ color: "tomato" }}>4 tomatoes </span>a day
          </li>
          <li>
            Solving algorithm problems on Leetcode, two easy problems and one
            medium level problem -->
            <span style={{ color: "tomato" }}> 4 tomatoes </span> a day
          </li>
          <li>
            Read <span style={{ fontStyle: "italic" }}>the Republic</span> by
            Plato --> <span style={{ color: "tomato" }}> 2 tomatoes </span>a day
          </li>
        </ul>
Wait, what's does it mean by tomatoes? Here's the answer, each tomato
        will be a time tracker. One tomato will be 25 minutes. Taking a short
        5-minute break time after a tomato would be recommended for our brains.
        Taking a break time can be helpful for us to think more creative way.
        After a first four tomatoes, taking a long 15 minutes break time is also
        recommended. Once you logged in this website, you will be able to make a
        to-do list with numbers of tomatoes you wish to work on.

<h1>What's the Pomodoro Technique about?</h1>
<p>
        It's one of the time management methods out there that's widely used.
        You can click &nbsp;

          href="https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique"

          here
        </a>
        &nbsp;to see the detail or if you want to see what studies were done
        regarding this technique, I'd recommend you to try watch this video. In
        this video, Barbara Oakley who is a professor of Engineering at Oakland
        University and gave a great speech at TEDx about how we can learn to
        learn. [https://www.youtube.com/embed/O96fE1E-rf8]
        <h2>Lastly...</h2>
        As we work on things daily basis, I believe there is nothing we cannot
        master. I'm a stronger believer in compound interest where doing one
        small thing a day will grow us exponentially. I hope you donâ€™t give up
        on whatever you are passionate about. Thank you again for taking your
        time using this website. Oh, try to click tomato logo on top menu if you
        want dark-mode on this website.
