       Why I built this website:
        </a>&nbsp;</h1>
      <p>
    &nbsp;
        As you know there are tasks to finish in a limited amount of time and
        also we'd agree that time is gold. Most people would also agree that the
        more we stay focused on one thing, we finish stronger and faster.
        However, it's also true that we tend to procrastinate even if we have
        tasks in front of us. Recently, I've been using a technique called&nbsp;
        <a
          style={{ color: "tomato" }}
          href="https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique"
          target="_blank"
        >
          the Pomodoro Technique
        </a>
        &nbsp;whenever I need to focus. Although this method has been immensly
        helpful for me to stay focused and stay away from procrastinating, I
        haven't found a website where I can break down on things I was working
        on.
      </p>
      <p>
        For an example, let's say I have some tasks to do on different things.
        Such as:
        <ul>
          <li>Continue writing an essay for my Philosophy of Science class</li>
          <li>
            Solving algorithm problems on Leetcode, two easy problems and one
            medium level problem
          </li>
          <li>
            Read <span style={{ fontStyle: "italic" }}>the Republic</span> by
            Plato
          </li>
        </ul>
        As the to-do list shows above, I implmeneted a feature where I can set
        how much time I will spend a day for each task. So the list would look
        like this.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Continue writing an essay for my Philosophy of Science class -->&nbsp;
            <span style={{ color: "tomato" }}>4 tomatoes </span>a day
          </li>
          <li>
            Solving algorithm problems on Leetcode, two easy problems and one
            medium level probelm -->
            <span style={{ color: "tomato" }}> 4 tomatoes </span> a day
          </li>
          <li>
            Read <span style={{ fontStyle: "italic" }}>the Republic</span> by
            Plato --> <span style={{ color: "tomato" }}> 2 tomatoes </span>a day
          </li>
        </ul>
        Wait, what's does it mean by tomatoes? Here's the answer, each tomato
        will be a time tracker. One tomato will be 25 mintues. Taking a short 5
        minute break time after a tomato would be recommended for our brains.&nbsp;

          Taking a break time can be helfup for us
        </a>&nbsp;
        to think more creative way. After a first four tomatoes, taking a long
        15 minutes break time is also recommended. Once you logged in this
        website, you will be able to make a to-do list with numbers of tomatoes
        you wish to work on.
