          As you know there are tasks to finish in a limited amount of time and
          also, we'd agree that time is gold. Most people would also agree that
          the more we stay focused on one thing; we finish stronger and faster.
          However, it's also true that we tend to procrastinate even if we have
          tasks in front of us. Recently, I've been using a technique
          called&nbsp;

            the Pomodoro Technique
          </a>
          &nbsp;whenever I need to focus. Although this method has been
          immensely helpful for me to stay focused and stay away from
          procrastinating, I haven't found a website where I can break down on
          things I was working on.
        </p>
        <h3>
          For an example, let's say I have some tasks to do on different things.
          Such as:
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Continue writing an essay for my Philosophy of Science class</li>
          <li>
            Solving algorithm problems on Leetcode, two easy problems and one
            medium level problem
          </li>
          <li>
            Read <span style={{ fontStyle: "italic" }}>the Republic</span> by
            Plato
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          {" "}
          As the to-do list shows above, I implemented a feature where I can set
          how much time I will spend a day for each task. So, the list would
          look like this.
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Continue writing an essay for my Philosophy of Science class -->{" "}
            <span style={{ color: "tomato" }}>4 tomatoes </span>a day
          </li>
          <li>
            Solving algorithm problems on Leetcode, two easy problems and one
            medium level problem -->
            <span style={{ color: "tomato" }}> 4 tomatoes </span> a day
          </li>
          <li>
            Read <span style={{ fontStyle: "italic" }}>the Republic</span> by
            Plato --> <span style={{ color: "tomato" }}> 2 tomatoes </span>a day
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          {" "}
          <span style={{ color: "tomato" }}>
            Wait, what's does tomatoes mean?
          </span>{" "}
          Here's the answer, each tomato will be a time tracker. One tomato will
          be 25 minutes. Taking a short 5-minute break time after a tomato would
          be recommended for our brains. Taking a break time can be helpful for
          us to think more creative way. After a first four tomatoes, taking a
          long 15 minutes break time is also recommended. Once you logged in
          this website, you will be able to make a to-do list with numbers of
          tomatoes you wish to work on.

          In this video, Barbara Oakley who is a professor of Engineering at
          Oakland University and gave a great speech at TEDx about how we can
          learn to learn, talks about this technique:{" "}

          As we work on things daily basis, I believe there is nothing we cannot
          master. I'm a stronger believer in compound interest where doing one
          small thing a day will grow us exponentially. I hope you donâ€™t give up
          on whatever you are passionate about. Thank you again for taking your
          time using this website.
